**KC Bomberman** is clone of the classic Bomberman game written in Java.

### News ###

2009/02/09: I have uploaded an alpha version with the work of the last weeks. New features: refactored audio and network systems that should now work with less problems than before. Internationalized versions are still missing. Please report problems with this version... and have fun while playing :-)

### Features ###
  * Using the Java Runtime Environment and TCP/IP for maximum portability
  * Tested on Linux and Windows (probably runs on most other systems)
  * User-Login
  * Lobby with Chat
  * Server supports multiple parallel games
  * Java2D playground window
  * Randomized playgrounds
  * Up to four players per game (both human and AI-controlled players)

### Hints ###

KC Bomberman uses the following additional libraries:
  * [XStream XML Serializer](http://xstream.codehaus.org/)
  * [MXP1 Fast XML Pull Parser](http://www.extreme.indiana.edu/xgws/xsoap/xpp/mxp1/index.html)

### We want you! ###
If you have some knowledge of Java and Network protocols, we would gladly welcome you as a new developer :-)
Currently the game is only in German, but we like to have the game in other languages. Perhaps you can help?

Note: there is a recent version in a Bitbucket mercurial repository: https://bitbucket.org/cli/kcbomberman/
